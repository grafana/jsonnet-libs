## BIG-IP Cluster Overview

The BIG-IP cluster overview dashboard provides high level details on node, pool and virtual server availability. Additionally, the top metrics for the server-side, outbound traffic, active members in pools, requested pools, queue depth, utilized virtual servers and latency virtual servers is shown.

## BIG-IP Log Overview

The BIG-IP log overview dashboard collects BIG-IP [syslog which are forwarded to grafana loki via promtail](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/PromtailRsyslogForwarderSetup). The dashboard can be used to monitor server, high availability, and audit logs using a logs volume and the raw logs panel. This dashboard includes query labels to filter logs such as job, host, syslog_facility, level and a regex search. The syslog_facility collects [enabled logs](https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K35284961) on the BIG-IP system which may include auth, authpriv, daemon, local0 and local6. Additional logs can be enabled depending on the users need.

The logs dashboard can be used to select a syslog_facility which are created when enabling different [log sources](https://clouddocs.f5.com/api/icontrol-soap/Log__Filter__Source.html) in BIG-IP. Some useful categorizes to enable are: 

| Log category          | log source                  | log description                                                                   | Syslog Facility files        |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Server logs           | LOG_SOURCE_BIGD(12)         | The process collecting health checking status logs.                               | `daemon`, `local0`           |
| Server logs           | LOG_SOURCE_AVR(7)           | The Application Visibility and Reporting module logs.                             | `daemon`, `local0`           |
| Server logs           | LOG_SOURCE_TMM(92)          | The Traffic Management Microkernel logs.                                          | `daemon`, `local0`           |
| High performance logs | LOG_SOURCE_HA(42)           | High Availability logs.                                                           | `daemon`, `local0`, `local6` |
| High performance logs | LOG_SOURCE_CHMAND(19)       | The chassis manager daemon logs.                                                  | `daemon`, `local0`, `local6` |
| High performance logs | LOG_SOURCE_CSYNCD(28)       | Replicating portions of the filesystem between cluster members on a VIPRION logs. | `daemon`, `local0`, `local6` |
| Audit logs            | LOG_SOURCE_ACCESSCONTROL(2) | Access control logs.                                                              | `auth`, `authpriv`           |
| Audit logs            | LOG_SOURCE_MCPD(58)         | The MCP daemon logs.                                                              | `daemon`, `local0`           |
| Audit logs            | LOG_SOURCE_SHELL(79)        | Shell commands logs.                                                              | `user`, `local0`             |


BIG-IP logs are disabled by default in the `config.libsonnet` and can be updated by setting `enableLokiLogs` to `true`. Then run `make` again to regenerate the dashboard:

```
{
  _config+:: {
    enableLokiLogs: true,
  },
}
```

To collect logs, [Promtail and Loki needs to be installed](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/installation/) and provisioned for logs with your Grafana instance. Logs are being forwarded using promtail which requires the following config with credentials:

```yaml
server:
  http_listen_port: 9080
  grpc_listen_port: 0

positions:
  filename: /tmp/positions.yaml

clients:
  - url: https://<user>:<pass>@logs-prod3.grafana.net/loki/api/v1/push

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: syslog
    syslog:
      listen_address: 0.0.0.0:40514
      # Don't disconnect the forwarder
      idle_timeout: 12h
      # use_incoming_timestamp: true
      listen_protocol: "udp"
      labels:
        job: "syslog"
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: ['__syslog_message_hostname']
        target_label: host
      - source_labels: ['__syslog_message_severity']
        target_label: level
      - source_labels: ['__syslog_message_facility']
        target_label: syslog_facility
      - source_labels: ['__syslog_message_app_name']
        target_label: syslog_identifier
```

## Alerts Overview

| Alert                            | Summary                                                                                                          |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BigIPLowNodeAvailabilityStatus | Detecting a significant number of unavailable nodes which can causes potential downtime or degraded performance. |
| BigIPServerSideConnectionLimit | Approaching the connection limit may lead to rejecting new connections, impacting availability.                  |
| BigIPHighRequestRate           | An unexpected spike in requests might indicate an issue like a DDoS attack or unexpected high load.              |
| BigIPHighConnectionQueueDepth  | A sudden spike or sustained high queue depth may indicate a bottleneck in handling incoming connections.         |

Default thresholds can be configured in `config.libsonnet`

```js
{
  _config+:: {
    dashboardTags: ['f5-bigip-mixin'],
    dashboardPeriod: 'now-30m',
    dashboardTimezone: 'default',
    dashboardRefresh: '1m',

    grafanaLogDashboardIDs: {
      'bigip-logs-overview.json': 'bigip-logs-overview',
    },

    // alerts thresholds
    alertsCriticalNodeAvailability: 95,  // %
    alertsWarningServerSideConnectionLimit: 80,  // %
    alertsCriticalHighRequestRate: 150,  // %
    alertsCriticalHighConnectionQueueDepth: 75,  // %

    enableLokiLogs: true,
    filterSelector: 'job=~"syslog"',
  },
}

```

## Install Tools

For linting and formatting, you would also need `mixtool` and `jsonnetfmt` installed. If you
have a working Go development environment, it's easiest to run the following:

```bash
go install github.com/jsonnet-bundler/jsonnet-bundler/cmd/jb@latest
go install github.com/monitoring-mixins/mixtool/cmd/mixtool@latest
go install github.com/google/go-jsonnet/cmd/jsonnetfmt@latest
```

The files in `dashboards_out` need to be imported
into your Grafana server. The exact details will be depending on your environment.

`prometheus_alerts.yaml` needs to be imported into Prometheus.

## Generate Dashboards And Alerts

Edit `config.libsonnet` if required and then build JSON dashboard files for Grafana:

```bash
make
```
