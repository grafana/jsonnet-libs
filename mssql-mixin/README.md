# Microsoft SQL Server mixin

The Microsoft SQL Server mixin is a set of configurable Grafana dashboards and alerts based on the Grafana Agent `mssql` integration.

The Microsoft SQL Server mixin contains the following dashboards:
- MSSQL overview
- MSSQL pages

## MSSQL Overview

The MSSQL overview dashboard provides details on traffic, errors, memory usage, IO performance, and error logs. To get MSSQL error logs, [Promtail and Loki needs to be installed](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/installation/) and provisioned for logs with your Grafana instance. The default MSSQL error log path is `/var/opt/mssql/log/errorlog` on Linux, and `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.*\MSSQL\LOG\ERRORLOG` on Windows. In order to show up in the dashboard, the logs must have a `log_type` label of `mssql_error`.

MSSQL error logs are enabled by default in the `config.libsonnet` and can be removed by setting `enableLokiLogs` to `false`. Then run `make` again to regenerate the dashboard:

```
{
  _config+:: {
    enableLokiLogs: false,
  },
}
```

## MSSQL Pages

The MSSQL pages dashboard provides details on page file usage and performance.

## Install tools

```bash
go install github.com/jsonnet-bundler/jsonnet-bundler/cmd/jb@latest
go install github.com/monitoring-mixins/mixtool/cmd/mixtool@latest
```

For linting and formatting, you would also need and `jsonnetfmt` installed. If you
have a working Go development environment, it's easiest to run the following:

```bash
go install github.com/google/go-jsonnet/cmd/jsonnetfmt@latest
```

The files in `dashboards_out` need to be imported
into your Grafana server. The exact details will be depending on your environment.

`prometheus_alerts.yaml` needs to be imported into Prometheus.

## Generate dashboards and alerts

Edit `config.libsonnet` if required and then build JSON dashboard files for Grafana:

```bash
make
```
