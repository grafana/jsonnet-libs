# Apache Cassandra Mixin

The Apache Cassandra mixin is a set of configurable Grafana dashboards and alerts.

The Apache Cassandra mixin contains the following dashboards:

- Apache Cassandra overview
- Apache Cassandra nodes
- Apache Cassandra keyspaces

and the following alerts:

- HighReadLatency
- HighWriteLatency
- HighPendingCompactionTasks
- BlockedCompactionTasksFound
- HintsStoredOnNode
- UnavailableWriteRequestsFound
- HighCpuUsage
- HighMemoryUsage

## Apache Cassandra Overview

The Apache Cassandra overview dashboard provides details on number of clusters, nodes and down nodes per cluster, timeouts, disk usage, and read/write requests for a Cassandra cluster.

## Apache Cassandra Nodes

The Apache Cassandra nodes dashboard provides details on disk/memory/cpu usage, garbage collections, number of pending/blocked compaction tasks, number and latency of reads/writes, and logs for a specific node in the cluster. To get Cassandra system logs, [Promtail and Loki needs to be installed](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/installation/) and provisioned for logs with your Grafana instance. The default Cassandra system log path is `/var/log/cassandra/system.log` on Linux.

Cassandra system logs are enabled by default in the `config.libsonnet` and can be removed by setting `enableLokiLogs` to `false`. Then run `make` again to regenerate the dashboard:

```
{
  _config+:: {
    enableLokiLogs: false,
  },
}
```

In order for the selectors to properly work for system logs ingested into your logs datasource, please also include the matching `instance`, `job`, and `cluster` labels onto the [scrape_configs](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/configuration/#scrape_configs) as to match the labels for ingested metrics.

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: integrations/apache-cassandra
    static_configs:
      - targets: [localhost]
        labels:
          job: integrations/apache-cassandra
          instance: '<your-instance-name>'
          cluster: '<your-cluster-name>'
          __path__: /var/log/cassandra/system.log
```

## Apache Cassandra Keyspaces

The Apache Cassandra keyspaces dashboard provides details on number and latency of Writes/Reads, Disk space used, number of pending compactions, and size of the largest table partition for a selected keyspace.

## Extendable Configuration

The configuration for this mixin also supports adding expected `rack` and `datacenter` labels. These selectors are not enabled by default but are easy to change by modifying the `config.libsonnet`.

```
{
  _config+:: {
    enableDatacenterLabel: true,
    enableRackLabel: true,
  },
}
```

## Alerts Overview

- HighReadLatency: There is a high level of read latency within the node.
- HighWriteLatency: There is a high level of write latency within the node.
- HighPendingCompactionTasks: Compaction task queue is filling up.
- BlockedCompactionTasksFound: Compaction task queue is full.
- HintsStoredOnNode: Hints have been recently written to this node.
- UnavailableWriteRequestsFound: Unavailable exceptions have been encountered while performing writes in this cluster.
- HighCpuUsage: A node has a CPU usage higher than the configured threshold.
- HighMemoryUsage: A node has a higher memory utilization than the configured threshold.

## Install tools

```bash
go install github.com/jsonnet-bundler/jsonnet-bundler/cmd/jb@latest
go install github.com/monitoring-mixins/mixtool/cmd/mixtool@latest
```

For linting and formatting, you would also need `jsonnetfmt` installed. If you
have a working Go development environment, it's easiest to run the following:

```bash
go install github.com/google/go-jsonnet/cmd/jsonnetfmt@latest
```

The files in `dashboards_out` need to be imported
into your Grafana server. The exact details will be depending on your environment.

`prometheus_alerts.yaml` needs to be imported into Prometheus.

## Generate dashboards and alerts

Edit `config.libsonnet` if required and then build JSON dashboard files for Grafana:

```bash
make
```
