## OpenStack overview

The OpenStack overview dashboard provides details on OpenStack services, alerts, cloud resource usage, hierarchy, and images.

# OpenStack logs

The OpenStack logs dashboard provides details on incoming OpenStack journald logs.
![OpenStack logs dashboard](https://storage.googleapis.com/grafanalabs-integration-assets/openstack/screenshots/openstack_logs.png)

OpenStack logs are enabled by default in the `config.libsonnet` and can be disabled by setting `enableLokiLogs` to `false`. Then run `make` again to regenerate the dashboard:

```
{
  _config+:: {
    enableLokiLogs: false,
  },
}
```

For the selectors to properly work with the OpenStack logs ingested into your logs datasource, please also include the matching `instance` and `job` labels in the [scrape configs](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/configuration/#scrape_configs) to match the labels for ingested metrics.

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: integrations/openstack
    journal:
      max_age: 12h
      labels:
        job: integrations/openstack
        instance: <your-instance-name>
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: ["__journal_systemd_unit"]
        target_label: "unit"
    pipeline_stages:
      - multiline:
          firstline: "(?P<level>(DEBUG|INFO|WARNING|ERROR)) "
      - regex:
          expression: '(?P<level>(DEBUG|INFO|WARNING|ERROR)) (?P<service>\w+)[\w|.]+ (\[.*] )(?P<message>.*)'
      - labels:
          level:
          service:
```

#### Logging to a file (optional)

This integration collects logs from journald, assuming that logging to a file is not configured. If you wish to configure a log file for your OpenStack services:

1. Create a `<service>.log` file.
2. Edit the `<service>.conf` file to include `log_file` and `level` config options.

```bash
log_file = /Path/to/log/dir/<service>.log
level =  WARNING
```
- Other possible `level` options are `DEBUG`, `INFO`, and `ERROR`.
3. Repeat steps 1 & 2 for each service.

```

## Install tools

```bash
go install github.com/jsonnet-bundler/jsonnet-bundler/cmd/jb@latest
go install github.com/monitoring-mixins/mixtool/cmd/mixtool@latest
```

For linting and formatting, `jsonnetfmt` must be installed. If you
have a working Go development environment, it's easiest to run the following:

```bash
go install github.com/google/go-jsonnet/cmd/jsonnetfmt@latest
```

The files in `dashboards_out` need to be imported
into your Grafana server. The exact details will depend on your environment.

`prometheus_alerts.yaml` needs to be imported into Prometheus.

## Generate dashboards and alerts

Edit `config.libsonnet` if required and then build JSON dashboard files for Grafana:

```bash
make
```
