  panel-units-rule:
    reason: Stat panels have no unit, and some panels use custom unit or text
  panel-title-description-rule:
    reason: Suppress noisy linting rule until we can address minor tech debt like this
  target-job-rule:
    reason: there are many platforms that generate "up" metrics, so for this panel this query has to be especific for the wso2 job
    entries:
    - panel: Servers Up/Down
