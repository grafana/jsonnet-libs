# NSQ Mixin

NSQ mixin is a set of configurable Grafana dashboards based on the metrics exported by the [NSQ statsd integration](https://nsq.io/components/nsqd.html#statsd--graphite-integration).
In order to use it, you would need https://github.com/prometheus/statsd_exporter or https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/agent/ with statsd integration enabled.

## Generate config files

You can manually generate dashboards, but first you should install some tools:

```bash
go install github.com/jsonnet-bundler/jsonnet-bundler/cmd/jb@latest
go install github.com/google/go-jsonnet/cmd/jsonnet@latest
# or in brew: brew install go-jsonnet
```

For linting and formatting, you would also need `mixtool` and `jsonnetfmt` installed. If you
have a working Go development environment, it's easiest to run the following:

```bash
go install github.com/monitoring-mixins/mixtool/cmd/mixtool@latest
go install github.com/google/go-jsonnet/cmd/jsonnetfmt@latest
```

The files in `dashboards_out` need to be imported
into your Grafana server.  The exact details will be depending on your environment.

Edit `config.libsonnet` if required and then build JSON dashboard files for Grafana:

```bash
make
```
