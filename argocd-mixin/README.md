## Alerts Overview
- ArgoAppOutOfSync: An ArgoCD application has status OutOfSync.
- ArgoAppSyncFailed: Sync Operation has failed for an ArgoCD Application.
- ArgoAppMissing: An ArgoCD application has status missing.

## Tools
To use them, you need to have `mixtool` and `jsonnetfmt` installed. If you have a working Go development environment, it's easiest to run the following:

```bash
$ go get github.com/monitoring-mixins/mixtool/cmd/mixtool
$ go get github.com/google/go-jsonnet/cmd/jsonnetfmt
```

You can then build a directory `dashboard_out` with the JSON dashboard files for Grafana:

```bash
$ make build
```
