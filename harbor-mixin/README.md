## Alerts Overview
- HarborComponentStatus: Status of Harbor components(Core, Registry, Database, JobService, Trivy, Notary and Redis )
- HarborProjectQuataExceeded: Harbor Porject has exceeded the assigned project quota
- HarborHighErrorRate: Harbor instance has high error rate in HTTP requests

## Tools
To use them, you need to have `mixtool` and `jsonnetfmt` installed. If you have a working Go development environment, it's easiest to run the following:

```bash
$ go get github.com/monitoring-mixins/mixtool/cmd/mixtool
$ go get github.com/google/go-jsonnet/cmd/jsonnetfmt
```

You can then build a directory `dashboard_out` with the JSON dashboard files for Grafana:

```bash
$ make build
```
